                                <h3 id="what">What is Steganography?</h3>
                                <p>Steganography (from Greek, <i>"steganos"</i> - concealed or covered, <i>"graphein"</i> - writing) is the method of concealing a secret signal within a cover signal. Those embedded signals may be sent through public channels, thus, the idea behind steganography is to hide them in a way that the intended secret signal does not attract attention to itself, so that the unintended recipients stay unaware of the secret communication.</p>

								<p>The complexity of steganographic methods lies in the difficulty of accomplishing at once three goals which are, namely:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Perceptual transparency</b>: which indicates the ability to avoid suspicions and is usually related to the degree of similarity and error between the original cover signal and the cover signal with the secret message embedded, also called as <i>stego signal</i>.</li>
                                    <li><b>The embedding capacity</b>  (also called "data rate" or "embedding rate"): which is defined as the maximum secret message size per 1-time unit (for instance, in kbps).</li>
                                    <li><b>Robustness</b>: defined as the ability to withstand intentional / accidental signal attacks.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>Focusing the steganography application in the acoustic domain adds another series of constraints as <span class="yell">embedding secret signals in audio is more challenging than embedding messages in other media, such as digital images</span>, due to the non-linear nature of the Human Auditory System (HAS) in contrast to the Human Visual System (HVS).
                                </p>
                                <h3 id="whatsofar">What has been done so far?</h3>
                                <p>Actually, it is interesting to look at the history of Audio Steganography as a gradual shift from the cognitive viewpoint to the psychoacoustic viewpoint. In order to review the evolution of Audio Steganography methods, let's have a look at those two contrasting viewpoints:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The <b>psychoacousticians</b> focus on low-level representation, i.e. they work with physical parameters (frequency) to observe whether or not the listener's featural representation of the tone (e.g., loudness or pitch) shifts.</li>
                                    <li>The <b>cognitivists</b> focus on high-level representation, i.e. they manipulate higher-level constructs, such as rhythm or scale.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br>
                                <p>Putting it simply, the psychoacoustic approach deems the spectral structure of sound, along with the complex pitch. representations, which are motivated by the physiological structure of neural activation patterns in the HAS. Whereas, the cognitive approach covers the symbolic representation of sound and pitch class representation is motivated by musical notational practice and symbolic representations that figure in cognitive studies, such as the note onset time and note pitch.
                                </p>
                                <h4 id="cognitive">The cognitive approach</h4>
                                <p>The symbolic representation of sound has been used from the earliest times, yet the first works that regard the use of those symbolic notations in steganographic methods address the XVIII-XIX centuries. Examples of early works include the <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Treatise_on_the_Art_of_Deciphering_and.html?id=bZJbewAACAAJ">"Treatise on the Art of Decyphering and of Writing in Cypher with an Harmonic Alphabet"</a>, from 1772 by Philipp Thicknesse (you can find the free version of the book on web archive). The cognitive approach for audio steganography is based on musical cryptograms, which are cryptogrammatic sequences of musical notes where each symbol has a mapping to a specific letter or set of letters.
                                </div>

									<img src="../img/steganography/steg2.png" alt="Steganography example"> 
								</div>
								<div class="wrapper">
									<div class="wrapped">
								<p>The main drawbacks of musical cryptograms are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Firstly, the mappings should be chosen in a way that, when played, the music should sound inconspicuously and harmonically, so much like any other composition that musically trained listeners would be easily fooled;</li>
                                    <li>Secondly, a mapping to text may be easy to concept, but a mapping to other domains such as image is not trivial whatsoever. </li>
                                </ul>  
                                <br>  
                                <p>Using musical properties, the first issue has been tackled, an example of a such a successful musical cipher is the <a href="https://wmich.edu/mus-theo/solfa-cipher/">"Solfa cipher"</a>, which maps letters onto only seven notes of the musical scale combined with unique durations, rather than use 26 different pitches for each letter of the alphabet, as suggested in works from the Romantic era. With an encryption key defined by four elements: a clef, a tonic, a mode, and a rhythmic unit.</p>
                                </p>
                                <h4 id="shift">The natural viewpoint shift</h4>
                                <p>The symbolic notation has some issues - the transcription of polyphonic pitch, i.e. converting an acoustical waveform into a parametric representation, where notes, their pitches, starting times and durations are extracted from the waveform. <span class="yell">Polyphonic pitches include natural sounds and noise sounds which cannot be transcripted in symbolic notation</span>. It can be seen straightforwardly that it is a difficult cognitive task and is not inherent in human perception of music.</p>

								<p>Considering the unavailability of reliable symbolic information, researchers sought for reliable feature extractors. Short-time Fourier transform and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients are two feature sets which have been typically widely adopted in audio processing systems. Their extrac- tion is largely based on the functionality of the HAS. Basically, when the sound energy comes into the cochlea, a sensory organ of hearing located in the inner part of the ear, different auditory cells give response for different frequency components of the incoming sound. <span class="yell">The cochlea acts like a frequency analyzer that decomposes the complex acoustical waveform signals into simpler frequency components</span>.</p>
                                <h4 id="psycho">The psychoacoustic approach</h4>
                                <p>The human ear transforms the incoming sound wave into frequency-dispersed nerve signals before the processing of the brain. Therefore it is biologically intuitive to analyze the sound wave signals by first converting it to the frequency domain, as it mimics the functionality of the human ear. This is how the trend has passed from the cognitive viewpoint to the psychoacoustic viewpoint and, along with the connectionist approaches, some audio systems started being built on neural networks with spectral audio features as input. In the 80-90's the connectionist approaches have been proven to be suitable for problems having fuzzy structures, and such one is sound.</p>
                                <p>In order to hide data efficiently in the spectral domain of a waveform, we need to get advantage of the properties (and vulnerabilities) of the HAS, some of which are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Frequency range</b>: refers to the range of frequencies that the humans are sensitive to. The range is about 15 Hz to 20,000 Hz (called “earshot”), and as humans age, the range becomes smaller (20 Hz to 16,000 Hz).</li>
                                    <li><b>Frequency discrimination</b>: refers to the ability of distinguishing sounds at two different frequencies. The ability to resolve tones decreases with the increase of frequency of the tone, e.g., the discrimination ability in the range 15 Hz to 2,000 Hz is 3-4 Hz, whereas for sounds near 10,000 Hz, the frequencies would have to differ by 30 Hz to be distinguishable.</li>
                                    <li><b>Sensitivity</b>: refers to the weakest signal that is just au- dible at a given frequency. Humans are most sensitive to sounds in the frequency range between 1,000 Hz and 3,000 Hz.</li>
                                </ul>
								<br>
                                <p>Based on the first property, we could think of hiding signals outside earshot. For instance, in the ultrasonic range (corresponding to frequencies above 20,000 Hz) or in the infrasonic range (below 15 Hz). This way the secret data would be publicly "in the air" but hidden to anyone not looking for it. Those systems do actually exist and they take advantage of the fact that those secret signals are inaudible and do not interfere with other sonic environments frequencies. Ultrasonic steganography and covert channels were proposed to transmit data between isolated computers and mobile devices, intended as a way to discreetly chat locally without exposing the communication to interception by a packet sniffer, and to perform cross-device tracking.</p> 
                                <p>Infrasonic steganography is less popular, but there have also been attempts, shows that binary data can be encoded into inaudible low-frequency sounds. When playing these sounds, speakers produce slight vibrations of the surface, which can be captured. However, using the inaudible frequency ranges is not always possible - it depends on the capabilities of the devices - and even, sometimes, it is not convenient. <span class="yell">Infrasounds (extreme bass waves) have been shown to cause unease, fear, depression and physical sensations</span>. You don't believe that? Just have a look at <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/htdocs/chem_background/exsumpdf/infrasound_508.pdf">this toxicological review on infrasounds (2001)</a>. Another example: "The Ghost in the Machine" (1998) explains <span class="yell">how infrasounds can create haunting</span>. In particular, how a broken metal fan in the lab caused the experience of a supernatural presence. The sound produced was measured to be at 18.98 Hz, which is below the human hearing range. Finally, if you're still not convinced, <span class="yell">have you ever wondered why suspense / horror movies are much scarier in cinemas?</span> Filmmakers use infrasounds to unnerve the audiences. A very famous case has been the showcase of Irreversible (2002) in Cannes and San Sebastian. The movie has a background noise with frequencies in the range of 22 to 36Hz (low frequency, almost inaudible). It was the main cause of people walking out of the theaters because they felt extremely anxious and uncomfortable. Just as an experiment, you can listen to Thomas Bangalter's <b>Rectum uncompressed tune (2002)</b>, using a variety of low frequencies. It's desperation and horror translated into soundwaves. In fact, the mentioned tune sounds like an emergency alarm. The word itself "alarm" etymologically comes from "all'arme" or "a las armas", literally "a call to arms" in the face of danger.</p>

								<p>If you're really interested further in how ultra and infra perisonics have been used as immaterial weapons in warfare, I recommend reading the book "Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear" (2012). It's a beautifully written and thought-provoking book with many philosophical / aesthetics references on cybernetics, afrofuturism and micropolitics to ponder.</p>
								<h3 id="classic">Classic Audio Steganography</h3>
								<p>And that's why classic audio steganographic methods darted around hiding signals within earshot and so has been the focus of my research.</p>
								<h4 id="lsb">LSB Algorithm</h4>
								<p>The classic audio steganographic algorithm is the <span class="yell">Least Significant Bit (LSB) coding</span>. The procedure consists in converting the secret and cover signals into bit streams and then replacing each LSB bit from the cover bytes by a bit from the secret. To extract the secret data, the receiver must access the LSB from the stego signal bytes. The main advantage of the LSB method is a very high channel capacity, however, the obvious drawback is the extremely low robustness of the method, due to the fact that random changes of the LSBs can destroy the embedded secret signal. To overcome this problem of the trivial LSB algorithm, many researchers have suggested variants that increase the robustness in the audio domain, at the cost of perceptual transparency and embedding capacity.</p> 
								<p>Below I provide samples of a <span class="yell">robust LSB for hiding text in audio waveforms</span>.</p>

								<h4 id="phasecoding">Phase Coding Algorithm</h4>
								<p>An example of an audio steganographic algorithm that attains inaudibility and robustness at the cost of data rate is <span class="yell">Phase Coding</span>, which embeds the secret signal into the phase of the cover signal using the fact that the HAS is insensitive to a constant relative phase shift in a stationary audio signal. </p>
								<p>Below I provide a sample of a variant of <span class="yell">Phase Coding for hiding text in audio waveforms</span>.</p>

								<h4 id="echohiding">Echo Hiding Algorithm</h4>
								<p>To conclude, the <span class="yell">Echo Hiding algorithm</span> is also worth mentioning, since this audio steganographic method attains data rate and robustness in a smart way, yet at the cost of inaudibility. Echo hiding hides the secret signal in the shape of echoes, this way, introducing changes to the cover signal that are characteristic of environmental conditions rather than random noise, as in LSB, thus it is robust in light of many lossy data compression algorithms. </p>

								<h3 id="deep">Deep Audio Steganography</h3>
								<p>In recent years, Deep Learning techniques have attracted the attention of steganography researchers. The first trials landed in the image domain, and unlike many popular steganographic classic methods that encode the secret signal within the least significant bits of the cover signal, deep learning approaches compress and distribute the secret signal's representation across all of the available bits. This is quite interesting because the neural networks learn where to place the secret data bits and how to encode them efficiently.</p>
								<p>In my work, I present a deep multimodal steganographic model for the transmission of visual information over audio. I really encourage <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to read our paper</a> or to watch my oral presentation at ICASSP 2022 (Singapore):</p>

								<p>We achieve quite impressive results and <span class="yell">we performed a pioneering experiment of image transmission through waveforms</span>. You can listen to several samples in the video below:</p>

								<p>We also conducted a <span class="yell">one-of-kind experiment</span> by performing a real image transmission through waveforms in a lab controlled setup, as shown in the figure below. We have used a Sennheiser e835 microphone with PreSonus USB mixer to transmit the waveforms with hidden images via PixInWav, and we used a Dyaudio BM6A speaker to capture them. The decoded images have lost a lot of information, though several patterns are still preserved. We have not taken into account the filters present in the devices and there was no noise reduction at the background. This experiment shows that method of transmitting image information through waveforms is feasible, at the very beginnings of its research path.</p>
