title: Overlay effect on click triggers all the overlay at a time
peek: I added an overlay effect to the card on clicking the three dots. But the problem arises, when i try to click the three dots in the first card, all 3 overlay are being showed simultaneously. I know the problem storing all 3 overlay div's in a variable. using forEach function to loop through it individually.
